<b>NOTE:</b> For each question, use only f-strings in the print statements.

## Question #1
Write a program that gets two numbers from the user and outputs a statement about those numbers for each of the comparison operators. The result of each comparison must be evaluated and then outputted as part of the statement. 

#### <ins>Sample Output:</ins>
```
Enter the first number: 2
Enter the second number: 3

2 < 3 is True
2 > 3 is False
2 <= 3 is True
2 >= 3 is False
2 == 3 is False
2 != 3 is True
```

## Question #2
Write another version of Question 1 such that you output statements that show the result of combining numerical expressions with comparison operators.

#### <ins>Sample Output:</ins>
```
Enter the first number: 2
Enter the second number: 3

(2 * 3) < (2 + 3) is False
(2 * 3) > (2 + 3) is True
(2 * 3) <= (2 + 3) is False
(2 * 3) >= (2 + 3) is True
(2 * 3) == (2 + 3) is False
(2 * 3) != (2 + 3) is True
```

## Question #3
Write a program that gets two strings from the user and outputs a statement about the strings for each of the comparison operators. The result of each comparison must be evaluated and then outputted as part of the statement.

#### <ins>Sample Output:</ins>
```
Enter the first word: apple
Enter the second word: orange

apple < orange is True
apple > orange is False
apple <= orange is True
apple >= orange is False
apple == orange is True
apple != orange is False
```
